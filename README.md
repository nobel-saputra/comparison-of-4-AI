# Simple Prompt, Surprising Results: A Landing Page Experiment

This project explores the capabilities of a language model to generate a website based on a very basic Indonesian prompt.

## Description

I conducted an experiment using Indonesian with a prompt that was arguably not optimal, and even potentially considered a poor practice for coding or website development assistance. However, I achieved a functional website using this simple prompt.

## Technologies Used

* **Tailwind CSS:** For responsive and efficient styling.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and functionality.

## Prompt Used

```
Buatkan aku website landing page menggunakan tailwindcss dan javascript mengenai properti rumah
```

Which translates to:

```
Create me a landing page website using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript about house properties.
```

## How to Run

1.  Download the generated HTML file.
2.  Open the HTML file in your web browser.

## Notes

* This experiment demonstrates the flexibility of the language model in understanding and responding to simple Indonesian prompts.
* The generated output serves as a starting point for further website development.
* More specific prompts will yield more detailed and tailored results.

## Future Development

* Implement additional features such as contact forms, image galleries, and location maps.
* Optimize the design for various screen sizes.
* Integrate with property APIs for dynamic data display.
