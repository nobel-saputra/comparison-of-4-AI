# AI-Powered Landing Page Experiment: Surprising Results from a Simple Prompt

This project is an experiment that tests the ability of various AI models to generate a website from a very basic prompt. The goal is to see how well AI can understand user intent and translate it into functional code, even with minimal instructions.

## Description

This experiment began with a question: can a decent website be created from just a very simple prompt? I used a common Indonesian prompt and observed how different AI models responded. The results were quite surprising! A functional landing page was successfully generated, demonstrating the potential of AI in web development.

The prompt used was:

Buatkan aku website landing page menggunakan tailwindcss dan javascript mengenai properti rumah
Which translates to:

Create me a landing page website using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript about house properties.
## AI Technologies Used

This experiment involved several leading AI models:

* **Gemini:** Google's multimodal AI model, capable of understanding and generating various types of content, including text and code.
* **Grok3:** xAI's AI model with access to real-time information via the X (Twitter) platform, enabling more contextual responses.
* **ChatGPT:** OpenAI's large language model, known for its ability to generate human-like text and code.
* **Claude AI:** Anthropic's AI model, focused on safety and helpfulness, designed for helpful and harmless conversations.
* **Blackbox AI:** An AI code editor that helps developers in creating program code.

## Process

1.  The same prompt was given to each AI model.
2.  The resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code was evaluated.
3.  The results were compared to observe differences in interpretation and code quality.

## Results

Despite the simplicity of the prompt, most AI models were able to generate code that could be rendered into a functional property landing page. This demonstrates the significant potential of AI to accelerate the web development process, even for users with limited technical knowledge.

## Conclusion

This experiment provides interesting insights into the ability of AI to understand natural language and generate code. While more specific prompts will yield better results, the ability of AI models to produce useful output from basic instructions is impressive. This opens up new possibilities for more accessible and efficient web development.
